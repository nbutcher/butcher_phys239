To get the plots for the assignment, run the file called "driver.py"
and it will generate plots. All plots will have a name indicating 
the physical property plotted and two numbers indicating what index
in the IC file provided the impact parameter and initial velocity.

The first digit gives the index in the impact parameter list, which
is by default set as
0 : 5000 Bohr radii
1 : 10000 Bohr radii
2 : 15000 Bohr radii
3 : 20000 Bohr radii
4 : 25000 Bohr radii

The second digit gives the index of the initial velocity list, which
is by default set as
0 : 1e7 cm/s
1 : 2e7 cm/s
2 : 3e7 cm/s
3 : 4e7 cm/s
4 : 5e7 cm/s

Plots of the trajectory, velocities, acceleration, and second time
derivative of the dipole moment are provided for case 00. Plots of 
the power spectrum are generated for all cases. The power spectrum
does not have a clear peak and is decreasing as frequency increases.
This might be an indication that I am not seeing the peak with my 
timestepping choice.
