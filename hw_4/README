The questions have been answered in the file "writeup.pdf" which also
provides sources for assumptions about stellar model and gas temperature.

The code to generate the final plot asked for in the assignment is provided in
this repository. There are two files, "read_dust.py" and "read_star.py", which
convert data files provided by sites linked to in the homework assignment to
hdf5 files that are used to generate their portions of the spectrum. For ease,
I have included the hdf5 files in the repository, so all that must be done to
generate the plot is run

python driver.py
